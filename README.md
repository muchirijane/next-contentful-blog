## Live Code - [Preview](https://next-contentful-blog-delta.vercel.app/)

## Description
- I learnt a lot about how to use Next Js to build a blog and as a first project to learn the framework I got to understand how powerful it is. I was able to understand how to use `createClient` function from the contentful package. 
- Connect contentful by obtaining the access token and space id. Then use getStatic props (asychronous function) to pass data as props to our component. 
- Apart from that I was able to use Image component from Next Js to showcase the featured or thumnail images in contentful and store the image src domains since they were fetched externally. 

### Feature add ons
- Create the next and prev page inside the single post to make navigation easier for users.
